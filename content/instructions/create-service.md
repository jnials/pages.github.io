To create a new service run

```bash
hugo new service/newservice/_index.md
```

Then you need to add the service by editing `content/service/_index.md`

```markdown
* [Dictator](dictator)
* [VenExit](venexit)
* [Node](node)
* [NewService](newservice)
```

You can add [new runbooks](../create-runbook/) to this service.
